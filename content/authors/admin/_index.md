My name is **Tomek Osiński** and I'm the author of this blog. The blog is full of networking topics, which I find interesting and worth to share with community. Mainly, I am going to publish tech tutorials & reports. However, some of my personal opinions or visions may also appear on this blog. Note that the posts are on my own and don't represent the opinions of my employer.

I'm a R&D Software Engineer in the area of Software-Defined Networking & Network Functions Virtualization and also an Open-Source enthusiast. My R&D activities are related to network softwarization including network automation & orchestration, Software-Defined Infrastructure (i.a. SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing, mobile networks and Telco Cloud technologies. Currently, my research is focused on improving the performance of the NFV workload, therefore I deal with data plane programmability and packet processing techniques for SDN and NFV systems. I'm involved in the project related to the [P4](http://www.p4.org) technology and [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org). So far, I have been contributing to various open-source projects including [Floodlight](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/), [ONOS](https://onosproject.org/) and [ONAP](http://www.onap.org).

Professionally, I work as a R&D Expert at [Orange Labs Poland](https://orangefab.pl/en/orange-rd-center/). Moreover, I am a PhD student at Warsaw University of Technology and the member of [SDN and Network Virtualization Lab](http://snvlab.tele.pw.edu.pl).
